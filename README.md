# To-Do-List Website
This is a simple and aesthetic To-Do List website to manage your todo's efficiently. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript and this was done completely in front-end. Later, I am planning on coming back to this project to add many more unique features such as a theme switcher or a way to sort tasks.
